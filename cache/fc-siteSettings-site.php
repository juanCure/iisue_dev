The notion of science  behind this Website is expansive, it therefore includes all those journals that publish original  research results in the diverse areas of knowledge (be it hard sciences, humanities, arts or  social sciences) and use a system of peer-review.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">The intention is not eliminating printed literature but being its complement. The Portal de  Revistas Científicas y Arbitradas de la UNAM (Spanish name standing for this Website)  confirms our commitment to the technology revolution, which seeks to shorten and facilitate  the process of electronic publishing and editorial management, in order to encourage more  people to access these materials.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">The services rendered by the Portal are enriched by the fact that it relies on the Open Journal Systems (OJS). This is an ambitious initiative that already operates in different countries  allowing a specific journal to receive articles, send them out for peer-review, design journals,  have a personalized web page, and most promising, allow the linkage with other similar  websites operated directly by over 200 universities worldwide.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">Open Journal Systems is an initiative designed to limit the commercialization (exclusive  circulation in commercial channels) of public funded science. Originally conceived to ensure  the free movement of published research outputs, OJS was the result of joint work by higher  education institutions located in the North America-region, where UNAM is located. It  operates through a partnership among the Faculty of Education at the University of British  Columbia, the Simon Fraser University Library, the School of Education at Stanford University,  and the Canadian Centre for Studies in Publishing at Simon Fraser University. This consortium  gave rise to the creation of the Public Knowledge Project ( PKP), which today internationally  articulates and supports technological development of this initiative that is, nevertheless,  handled in an independent and decentralized manner by each country and institution.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">Since this project is designed to facilitate access to scientific information, the National  Autonomous University of Mexico adopts this tool as a testimony of its commitment to  the circulation of scientific production in national and international circuits that neither  compromises its ability to be part of international indexes such as Scopus, nor the independent  character of each journal.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">Since February 2011, most of the production of the last three years pertaining to 53 of the 111  scholarly-refereed journals of the UNAM may be consulted directly. At the same time, other  five journals appearing in the Portal de Revistas Científicas y Arbitradas de la UNAM, even  though they are not in circulation, were included for their historical value, as well as three  guest journals belonging to other universities. The Website is organized by area of knowledge,  by publisher and by the name of the journal.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">The Portal will provide additional services such as the link to the Catalogue of Refereed  Scholarly Journals 2010-2011, available in four languages, and will allow the query of the  available material in more than one language.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">An ever-increasing number of journals is expected to join the Refereed Scholarly Journals  Website in the near future, and continuous training of our editors that use this space is  underway. Training is directed for its usage not only as repository but also as a dynamic tool  for decentralized administration, as an instrument for subscription online and for submitting  articles to arbitration processes, as well as a liaison with readers and authors via the e-mail  service, which is provided to them.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">The objectives of the Refereed Scholarly Journals Website are to implement technologies  serving the circulation of science between different audiences (be it students, academics,  researchers, journalists or the general public), as well as promoting easy access technological  appropriation and increasing the value of scientific production by means of multypling  exchanges. Thus combined with the appropriate classification, with the diffusion of science  and transparency, the National Autonomous University of Mexico locates itself at the  forefront of the public circulation of knowledge.</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">Dr. Eduardo Bárzana García</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">General Secretary</p> <p style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica Roman; font-size: 12px; color: #2b2b2b; line-height: 1.5; font-weight: regular;">Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</p></div>',
